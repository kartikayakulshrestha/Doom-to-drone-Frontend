Note on Vercel
I've been using Vercel for a while now, and there are several reasons why I really enjoy it:

Ease of Deployment: Vercel makes the deployment process incredibly simple. With just a few clicks, I can deploy my projects directly from GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. This seamless integration saves a lot of time and effort.

Serverless Functions: Vercel's serverless functions allow me to run backend code without managing any infrastructure. This is perfect for creating APIs and handling backend logic, all while focusing on the front-end development.

Performance Optimization: Vercel automatically optimizes my projects for performance. Features like CDN, caching, and image optimization ensure that my applications are fast and efficient.

Preview Deployments: Every pull request gets its own unique URL for preview deployment. This feature is invaluable for testing and sharing changes before merging them into the main branch.

Custom Domains and HTTPS: Setting up custom domains is straightforward, and Vercel provides automatic HTTPS for secure connections. This enhances the professionalism and security of my applications.

Scalability: Vercel scales with my projects. Whether it's a small personal project or a large-scale application, Vercel handles the traffic without any issues.
